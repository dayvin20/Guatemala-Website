    <p class="card-text">Let's go back to the origins of textile production in Guatemala. In ancient times, these jungles were home to the Maya people, one of the largest and most complex civilizations of the ancient Western Hemisphere. The Maya lived in tightly organized city-states, practiced advanced architecture and astronomy, and were the only culture in the hemisphere to develop a true system of writing. The Maya did a lot, but one of their most revered artistic traditions was textile production.

According to Maya traditions, the people were taught to spin plant fabrics into yarn and weave them into textiles by the goddess, Ix Chel. Ix Chel was a moon goddess, earth goddess, and embodiment of wisdom, fertility, and female virtues - depending on which form she decided to take on a particular day - who was said to have woven the cycles of life. She is often shown wearing a backstrap loom, which is the traditional Maya loom. This loom is actually worn by the weaver, strapped around the back and waist, and anchored to a tree or similar object.

The fact that the Maya have a goddess of weaving tells us something about the importance of this tradition. It was revered above nearly all other art forms and practiced by noble and common women alike from a young age. While the Maya filled their world with characteristically colorful and vibrant woven textiles, perhaps the most significant was a traditional garment called the huipil. Each huipil was carefully and intricately designed to feature symbolic images and patterns that went far beyond simple aesthetics. </p>
